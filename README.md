## Technologies Used

### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using PyPlot. 

### Database Storage
The "database" is simply a csv at the moment. But in order to integrate it with our webpage, we may later be using SQLite. SQLite also may be beneficial to more easily generate queries for the pertinant pitcher data. 

### Machine Learning
Matthew has mocked up a gradient boosted classifer, a logistic model, and a neural network. 

### Dashboard
We will use both Flask and D3.json to create an interactive model. The model will be hosted on github.
